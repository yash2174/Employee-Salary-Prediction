# Employee-Salary-Prediction

This project demonstrates how to use regression techniques to predict employee salaries based on various features like job role, experience, education, industry, and location. It includes end-to-end steps from data generation, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## ðŸš€ Project Features

- Synthetic employee dataset with realistic business logic
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with plots
- Feature engineering (custom features like experience squared, ratio metrics)
- Model training using:
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge & Lasso Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- Evaluation using RÂ², RMSE, MAE, Cross-validation
- Feature importance analysis
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Final predictions on new sample employee profiles
